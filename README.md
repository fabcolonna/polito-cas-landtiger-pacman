This is an implementation of the Pac-Man game for the **LandTiger**, an ARM-based LPC1768 board, developed from stratch as a project for the course of Computer Architectures at Politecnico di Torino (MSc in Computer Engineering).

## Custom peripherals library

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-GitHub%20Pages-blue)](https://fabcolonna.github.io/polito-cas-landtiger-lib/)

The game is written in C, and has been developed using my custom library for the board, which is available [here](github.com/fabcolonna/polito-cas-landtiger-lib), using the sample Keil project available in the `sample` branch of the library repository. Check out the Doxygen documentation of this library by clicking on the badge above.

Refer to the [README](https://github.com/fabcolonna/polito-cas-landtiger-lib/blob/main/README.md) of the library for more info.
