This is an implementation of the Pac-Man game for the **LandTiger**, an ARM-based LPC1768 board, developed as a project for the course of Computer Architectures at Politecnico di Torino. The game is written in C, and uses my custom library for the board peripherals, which you can find [here](https://github.com/fabcolonna/polito-cas-landtiger-lib).

## Project Specifications

The PDFs of the project specifications and the final report can be found in the `docs/` folder. Further details will be gradually added to this file during development, alongside instructions for building and running the game.
