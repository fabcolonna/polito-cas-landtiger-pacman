# PacMan Game for the LPC1768

This is an implementation of the PacMan game for the ARM-based LPC1768 board, developed as a project for the course of Computer Architectures at Politecnico di Torino. The game is written in C and uses my custom library for the LPC peripherals, which you can find [here](https://github.com/fabcolonna/polito-cas-lpclib).

## Project Specifications

The PDFs of the project specifications and the final report can be found in the `docs/` folder. Further details will be gradually added to this README during the development, alongside instructions for building and running the game.
